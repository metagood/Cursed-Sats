Cursed satsðŸ‘¹are a hidden gem ðŸ‘‡

- Cursed sats are largely hidden on marketplaces today, and now is a good time to hunt for them.
- Cursed sat floor is probably undervalued: lower supply, larger holder base, and much lower floor price compared to Uncommon sats and Bitmaps.
- Cursed sats are a great collectible, and good entry for new Ordinals collectors.
- Some Cursed sats could become some of the most historic and valuable collectibles in the world!
- A few cursed collections stand out for being first to experiment with important new techniques that later became the standard in the Ordinals protocol.
- @OnChainMonkey OCM Genesis was the first 10k collection inscribed with the collection standard on Bitcoin, before it became standard in the Ordinals protocol, so OCM became Cursed for being early, and the first.ðŸ‘¹

ðŸŸ§ What are Cursed sats?

Cursed sats are sats that contain Cursed inscriptions, the artifacts of early Ordinals. Cursed inscriptions are no longer allowed, so no new Cursed sats can be created. Cursed sats are like block 9 or 450x sats, sats that get more historic over time, and can be used as a canvas for future inscriptions. And Cursed sats are much rarer than block 9, 450x, or Uncommon sats!

ðŸŸ§ Why are Cursed sats valuable?

Cursed sats are rare, and their supply is fixed. The inscriptions already on Cursed sats are diverse, and some of them will be the most coveted collectibles of Bitcoin. A few inscriptions are cursed because they were first to experiment with new techniques that advanced Ordinals. For example, the first collections to use the Parent-Child Provenance standard for collections are cursed. The early experiments with reinscription are cursed. Early batch inscriptions are cursed. These techniques have become standard in the Ordinals protocol today.

ðŸŸ§ More Alpha: OCM Genesis - First and Cursed.

- OCM Genesis was cursed multiple times, among the few sats cursed 3+ times.
- OCM Genesis was cursed for being the first 10k to use Parent-Child Provenance, the future standard for collections on Bitcoin.
- OCM Genesis was cursed for being the first 10k collection to use Reinscription.
- OCM Genesis are among the few cursed on Block 9, 450x sats.
- OCM Genesis was the first 10k collection inscribed on Bitcoin in parent Inscription 20219 (Feb 2023) for distribution using Recursive Inscriptions, another future standard for Ordinal inscriptions.
- Bitcoin and Ordinals are both about one thing, "stacking sats." Collecting the floor sats, or collecting the grail rarest sats. OCM Genesis was designed around the sat, and creating the rarest sats: 45017800001â€“45017810000. These 10k sats are in the 99.999999th percentile of earliest ranges, and the first 10k range to be inscribed ever on Bitcoin. The rarest 10k collection and First and Cursed.ðŸ‘¹
